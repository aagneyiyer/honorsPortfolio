## Context

I discovered the Applied Hearing Science Lab (AHSLAB) when I stumbled upon a posting for an independent study on the undergraduate research opportunities database. It was titled "Modeling Speech Perception through Cochlear Implants" and involved an intriguing blend of biology, computer science, and bioengineering. I worked on this project with a bioengineering student throughout Spring 2023 under Dr. Yi Shen, the head of the AHSLAB. Though intriguing, much of the project was explorative and self-directed, leaving myself and my labmate scratching our inexperienced heads. Furthermore, the project demanded the use of proprietary, often esoteric hardware and software with little documentation to guide us. While 

As Spring quarter drew to an end, I looked to shift projects within the lab. I received the opportunity to work on a mobile app built with modern technologies (TypeScript, React, Git) that I've covered in my degree coursework. Here, I would be working on an interdiscplinary team alongside students in Human Centered Design & Engineering, Speech & Hearing Sciences, and a fellow Computer Science major. The project is led by a Speech & Hearing Sciences PhD candidate, Bertan Kursun. I accepted and thus began my summer engagement.

## Goal 

Traditionally, fitting hearing aids requires audiometric tests using specialized equipment, as well as fine tuning that may be conducted across several weeks. We aim to make this process more streamlined and accessible to the 85% of hearing-impaired Americans with unmet hearing healthcare needs. 

How do we aim to accomplish this? Our lab has developed a mobile-based web app that allows patients to adjust settings on their own hearing aids, and fit their exact audiometric profile. This process is called "self-fitting". We aimed to make the app as accessible and easy to use as possible for elderly patients with less familiarity with modern software. 

When I joined the project, our application had one main fitting interface: a 5x5 grid across which users drag a cursor that adjusts the frequencies of their hearing aids. The user is taken through 20-ish trials of this grid, continuously dragging the cursor until the sound feels the best for them, which iteratively perfects their hearing.

My goal throughout this summer was to implement a new fitting interface: a set of tappable buttons that each apply some certain adjustment to different frequencies on their hearing aids. Similarly to the grid interface, the user is taken through different trials, which iteratively imrpove their hearing aid experience. Aside from this new button interface, we wanted to give the app a total aesthetic redesign to make it both user-friendly for older patients and more presentable to potential funders of our lab. We aimed to host clinical trials for patients scheduled for the end of August, so our timeline was clearly defined.

## Process & Outcome

I'm really grateful to have been able to contribute to a project like this. It's not the first codebase I've worked on collaboratively, but I do feel that it's the first one that offers such a clear, tangible benefit to future users. All aspects of the project were clearly defined - the who, the what, the when, the why, and the how - which allowed me to focus in on the actual software development without worrying about project logistics. As I mentioned earlier, this is part of the reason I chose to join this project; it was so concretely defined by the time I joined, and it had an existing codebase for me to contribute to. I could start contributing immediately; I made my first pull request (code contribution) within my first week of joining, and I knew those changes would be included in the final version of the app. After Spring quarter's project filled with question marks and uncertainty, it was incredibly refreshing to work on something so concrete.   

Prior to this project, I had the misconception that the process of building software was far removed from the actual end users of that software. That is, I never believed that I'd be thinking about the *why* or the *who* when cranking out lines of code; I instead believed that writing code is purely analytical and mathematical. However, the reality was different. With each annoying bug I had to fix, every new feature I had to implement, and all the seemingly tedious aesthetic adjustments our team made, I envisioned elderly patients using our app and appreciating every last detail. Somehow, writing code began to have a degree of humanness and emotion involved, as I associated each function with a purpose in the larger goal of improving an older person's life. This notion is what made this project much more enjoyable to work on than the class projects in CSE 331. Though our self-fitting app involved virtually the same technology stack as CSE 331 projects, knowing that my hard work will be put towards more than just a GPA is such a significant motivator. From this takeaway, I've learned that I truly do care about what I build in the future, and whether I'm working in the industry, I will need to be truly aligned with my company's mission if I want to feel fulfilled in my work.  

While the scope of our app's target audience is limited to local patients of the UW Speech and Hearing Clinic, the work I did this summer felt incredibly rewarding. I felt that the strengths of mine that contributed the most to my success were my patience and willingness to learn. In engineering settings and, more broadly, research settings, the demands are constantly changing. I worked on entire features that we ended up havingn to scrap and completely redo simply because we decided another solution would be optimal. Keeping up with these changing minds and wanting to improve relentlessly required patience, which I .

Another aspect of this project that I'm incredibly thankful for was the team's interdisciplinarity. I learned a ton from Bertan, the PhD student leading the project, about audiology and acoustics. He answered all my questions - even the shockingly obvious ones. Though he doesn't come directly from a computing background, I was surprised by his grasp on programmming and how he was able to switch seamlessly from thinking about the app's algorithm to its aesthetic design. We're also blessed to have Jason in our lab; he's a third-year computer science major and hands down the most talented, experienced developer I've directly worked with. He implemented basically the entirety of what was there when I joined this project. I learned a lot from him about using Git for version control, including merging changes and working across multiple branches.

## Conclusion

As of August 21st, 2023, and we're done with all main functional and aesthetic changes to the app. Last week, we did a rehearsal of a clinical trial, and made some last adjustments to the instructional pages. All that I worked on this summer can be seen at https://github.com/AHSLab-UW/self-fitting-gui. We have patients coming in in the coming weeks to tune their hearing aids with our app, and I'm satisfied and rewarded by the project. I hope to continue contributing to lab in the upcoming school year, whether it's the same project or a new one.

## Conclusion

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
  df,
  lat='Latitude',
  lon='Longitude',
  z='Magnitude',
  radius=10,
  center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
  zoom=0,
  mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
