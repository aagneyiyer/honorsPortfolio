Hi! I'm Aagney Iyer, and I'm from Kirkland, WA. I'm a second-year computer science major in the Interdisciplinary Honors Program here at the University of Washington. I enjoy the beautiful game (&#9917;), journaling, thrifting, driving at night with the windows down, running across the 520 bridge, and eating too much from my favorite restaurants.

I intend to use my [Honors](https://honors.uw.edu/reqs/portfolio/) portfolio as a way to document and reflect on the most character-building academic and extracurricular experiences along my undergraduate journey. In doing so, I hope to grow as a scholar and as a person while creating a time capsule of sorts for me to recount my college days.

Feel free to email me at [aagney@uw.edu](mailto:aagney@uw.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aagneyiyer/), which I spend way too much time on. Thanks for stopping by!
